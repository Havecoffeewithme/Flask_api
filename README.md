# Flask_api
This project demonstrates the development of a modern REST API using the Flask web framework, with a focus on separating back-end logic from front-end interactions. Over three stages, the project showcases how to build a robust, database-backed API and integrate dynamic documentation.


Key features include:

API Foundation: Setting up a Flask project with Connexion, defining endpoints with the OpenAPI specification, and testing with Swagger UI.
Database Integration: Configuring a SQLite database, using SQLAlchemy for ORM, and leveraging Marshmallow for data serialization and validation.
Advanced Relationships: Managing one-to-many database relationships, implementing nested schemas with Marshmallow, and showcasing related data in API responses.
This project is a practical introduction to building scalable, well-documented REST APIs suitable for modern web applications.
